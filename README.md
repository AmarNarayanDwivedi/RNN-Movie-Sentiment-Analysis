# RNN Movie Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
**RNN Movie Sentiment Analysis** is a project that uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to analyze and predict the sentiment of movie reviews. The model classifies reviews into two categories: positive or negative. This project leverages the IMDB movie review dataset to train the RNN and evaluate the sentiment of textual data effectively.

## Features
- Sentiment classification: Predicts whether a movie review is positive or negative.
- Utilizes Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to process sequential data.
- Trained on the IMDB dataset with over 25,000 reviews.
- Achieves high accuracy in sentiment prediction.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rnn-movie-sentiment-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd rnn-movie-sentiment-analysis
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Dataset
The project uses the IMDB Movie Review Dataset, which contains 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. The dataset is preprocessed to convert the text into a numerical format suitable for input to the RNN model.

## Model Architecture
The model uses an Embedding Layer for text representation, followed by a SimpleRNN layer to capture sequential dependencies in the review data. Finally, a Dense output layer predicts the sentiment (positive or negative) of each review.
