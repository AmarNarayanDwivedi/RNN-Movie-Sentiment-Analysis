# RNN Movie Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
**RNN Movie Sentiment Analysis** is a project that uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to analyze and predict the sentiment of movie reviews. The model classifies reviews into two categories: positive or negative. This project leverages the IMDB movie review dataset to train the RNN and evaluate the sentiment of textual data effectively.

## Features
- Sentiment classification: Predicts whether a movie review is positive or negative.
- Utilizes Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to process sequential data.
- Trained on the IMDB dataset with over 25,000 reviews.
- Achieves high accuracy in sentiment prediction.
